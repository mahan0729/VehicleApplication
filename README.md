# VehicleApplication

# I ran out of time.
# The database (Vehicle.mdf) is included in the project.
# The .yaml file is included in the project.
# I could not get a working version, therefore, making an image->container was, basically, a waste of time.

# Even though I added the .yaml file to github, the URL is https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Vehicle-Sales/Vehicle-Sales/1.0.0#trial

# Within that, I was making the the Get queryable, on the following: Make, Model, Year and color.  
# Even though I made a Post, I read the requirements again, and it did not mention the basic CRUD functionality.

# The result of the get, would have returned Make, Model, Year, Color, Price and Mileage

#  I did not get to the unit tests, as that was downstream, same as the pagination.
